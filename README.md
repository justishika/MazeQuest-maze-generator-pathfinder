# MazeQuest: Pathfinding AI

**MazeQuest** is a Python-based project that generates random mazes and implements pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest path from a start point to a target point. The project is designed to showcase the power of search algorithms in navigating mazes and solving pathfinding problems.

---

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: Generates random maze layouts with walls and open paths.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implements a BFS-based algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the target.
- **Dynamic Start and Target**: The start and target positions are dynamically set within the maze.
- **Visualization**: Prints the maze layout and the shortest path from the start to the target.
- **Interactive**: Allows users to visualize maze generation and pathfinding in real time.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MazeQuest.git
